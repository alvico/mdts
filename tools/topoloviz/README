Overview
--------


This tool allows you to visualize MidoNet virtual topology
with graphvitz[1]. The tool is intended for debugging
purpose, and not meant to be used by customers in their day to day
operations. When you run the tool, it produces image files to visualize
the virtual topology inside MidoNet.


Usage Example
-------------

```
./topoloviz.py   --midonet_url http://localhost:8080/midonet-api
```


Notes
-----

- The tool uses pydot python library to wrap dot language[2] and
  generate image files.

- Currently the tool only supports MidoNet API as a mean of getting virtualy
  topology data. But supporting zookeeper dump file generated by zkdump[3]
  should be useful for offline processing especially for troubleshooting
  customer problems; there's a skelton class in vta.py

- We may want to merge this tool and zkdump under a more generic
  module name e.g. midonet-tools and package them so we can install them
  as a utility tools package.

- Depends on graphviz, pydot. And pyhton-argparse in RHEL in whihch
  python2.6 is still the system installed python version.
  You need to manually install dependencies.
