--------

Tests are written in python nose test framework.
For more details on nose framework, see https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


Running tests
--------------

 - simply run all

  $ nosetests

  Be sure to add the top directory of the qa repo to PYTHONPATH


 - verbose mode (with -v)

  $ nosetests -vv

 - supress output capturing

  * -s for standard output. This is needed if you add pdb.set_trace() in the
     middle of the test code.

   * --nologcapture for debug logs

 - for debugging, there are options for hooking up pdb upon an error
   or a failure.

   * --pdb
   * --pdb-failures
